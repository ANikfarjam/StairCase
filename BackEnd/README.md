# Goal

we are aiming to make this game playable on multiple devices at the same time

### What we Need for Multiplayer Hosting

We need to split your game into client and server components:

1. Client (Player UI using Pygame)
Each player runs a Pygame program that sends actions to the server and receives game state updates.

This will not be run from Flask ‚Äî players run it locally.

2. Server (Flask or socket-based game logic)
The Flask app manages game state, handles player turns, updates the board, etc.
