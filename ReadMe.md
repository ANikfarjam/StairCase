This is an ancient Persian game bringing friends and family together. We decided to develop this game for PC and Mac to allow people to play together and bring the old memories of this game back. We are excited to see how we can tie all of our skills together to make a full stack game, and get to experience other peopleâ€™s joy of the game. We hope to develop our full stack game development utilizing langchain and lang graph to leverage LLMs to develop our game application with. 

### <span style="color: green">How to play this game?</span>

This is an old school board game similar to Snakes & Ladders where the goal is to make it to the end faster than others. There are obstacles as well as rewards. The gameboard is an NxN grid. In random places there will be ladders that take you ahead and snakes that push you back. Since we are creating a digital version of this game, we are aiming to add extra elements to this game such as random mini challenges, such Trivia and Hangman, and effects (ex: rolling pairs allows you to go again) that rewards players. You earn coins for winning, and there is a shop that allows you to unlock new background themes.
